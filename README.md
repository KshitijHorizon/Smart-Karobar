# Smart-Karobar
The mobile application project “Smart Karobar” was proposed and developed in this PAT005-2 Assessment-2 Group Mobile Application Development E-Portfolio. This app was proposed to transform the traditional way of Real Estate business to digitalized online platform where seller and buyer can perform transaction without physically field visit and meeting personally. Smart Karobar will definitely revolutionize real estate business as its motto focus on providing “Ultimate online platform for selling, renting and buying properties”. Smart Karobar will rely on the main idea of searching properties (both normal and advanced search), adding property, property category on the basis of style, purpose, and location and finally booking inquiry and contacting the seller/buyer through their valid details. Smart Karobar, enabling features of online real estate will be the great solution for anybody in web and mobile platform seeking to rent, buy and sell property online.
